The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:
Requirement analysis
Planning
Software design such as architectural design
Software development
Testing
Deployment
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.
SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time.
SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects.
